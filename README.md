Compiling from command line
=============================

PolandBall uses Ant build system as of now, to run it, execute:

    ant compile
    ant jar
    ant run

For a quick run you can as well just use the last command as it would imply running others first. The resulting JAR will be created in the *build/jar* subdirectory.

Licence: open source, do whatever you want with it, but do not blame us.
