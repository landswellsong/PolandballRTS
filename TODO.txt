TODO:


-Level design (Sprite based isometric or simple tiles)
-AI
-UI
-UDP server and client (?)

I will make the level design and the AI completely by myself but it would be nice if someone takes the UI part.
 I can do that, but I'd need mockups on how you intend it too look/work. t. landswellsong
 -The problem is, as far as we're not sure about the game play and level design, we can't really do the UI yet.
 E.g. a minimap would be a black square with white dots for own units and red dots for visible enemies.
 The selected units should be displayed (I'll limit them), there has to be a main menu, an init screen and so on.
 There is yet too little information about the end product but I'd appreciate your help a lot in the near future
 (1-2 weeks?) Keep updated (as I'll keep git updated) t. cirrus

 
The server will be the last thing.


Side-objectives: storyline? buildings? more like an adventure?

Open for suggestions
