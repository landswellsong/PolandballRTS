TODO:


-Level design (Sprite based isometric or simple tiles)
-AI
-UI
-UDP server and client (?)

I will make the level design and the AI completely by myself but it would be nice if someone takes the UI part.
The server will be the last thing.


Side-objectives: storyline? buildings? more like an adventure?

Open for suggestions
