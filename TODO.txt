Polandball RTS TODO

What I expect the end product to be:

Gameplay should be fun and smooth, kind of like Starcraft, which just feels right
Network functionality! People should be able to play via the internet against and
with each other.
The AI should be responsive, the units somewhat self aware on what happens next to them.
It should have a nice GUI.
Buildings and vehicles of different kinds will be included, as well as base and unit building.
The units should be customizable. Different weapons, buffs, mounts(?) etc...
Interaction with the environment should be possible. Manipulating the map for your own favor
as a sandbox element alone should make the game more unique to any rts so far.

Details, what Cirrus will do himself in the near future:
-AI (A* pathfinding algorithm)
-Item entities
-fog of war
-basic vehicles
-(open)

Open TODOs for the near future, feel free to contribute here:

-GUI
-UDP server and client, packets
-sound
-more artwork

Feel free to contribute! Your code will always be inspected, so if you're not sure
about bugs or anything else, let us know. Use the personal contact if you want to contribute outside git,
like artwork, music and that kind.

Always keep in mind that we're doing open source here.
